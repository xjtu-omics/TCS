# TCS
This package gradually realized the calculation of amino acid distance and TCS score. It would be used in clinical comparison of TCR. we focused on the level of TCR V-J combination (VJ). Based on the priori knowledge that T cell clonal expansion occurs when antigen-driven activated and peptides recognizing the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features, we characterized two key features of VJs including clonal expansion (F50) and chaos, and propose a novel score termed TCS as the ratio between F50 and chaos to quantify VJ.
